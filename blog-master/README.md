This is my personal blog based on Gatsby's blog starter -when I was a fan of static sites.

The site address is https://wronganswer.blog and covers competitive programming problems as well as my neighborhood programming club activities.

I unfortunately do not have time to update it right now and push my solutions to github directly.
