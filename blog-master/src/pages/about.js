      <h3>What is that all about?</h3>
      <p>
        This blog has some solutions to competitive programming problems from
        different judges online, mostly
        <a href="www.kattis.com"> kattis</a>. Many
        <a href="https://github.com/Dajamante"> solutions </a> are on github, so
        don't hesitate to have a look there!
      </p>

      <p>
        I struggled with most of those and they taught me a lot (painfully). My
        solutions are in no way a set of best practices or best solutions (thank
        Goodness!). Competitive programming is just a way to learn programming
        and have fun.

        There is also activities I do with kids at the Tellus Programming Club,
        and other school projects.

        Tellus is a programming club in Midsommarkransen that I started in
        September 2019. We learn to code in Python.

      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I live in Stockholm, and some days my programming go as smoothly as
        A&#65284;AP's routine visit to our beautiful city.
