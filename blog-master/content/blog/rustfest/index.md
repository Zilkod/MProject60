After hanging out in the Rust community this incredible thing just happened. I got to present the robot at [Rustfest Global](<https://rustfest.global/session/21-build-your-own-(rust-y)-robot/>), and Andre [LLogiq](https://twitter.com/llogiq) Bogus even did the OST! Just wait for it at the end, or skip to it, it's the best part!
