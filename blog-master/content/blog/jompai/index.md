### Obstacle avoiding robot with PIC32MX

The WrongAnswer staff (myself) has been absent for a while on that blog. It has been busy at school, mostly with a really fun course called Computer Organisation and Hardware Engineering.

My lab partner Johanna Löv and myself are now almost ready to present our project, which is an obstacle avoiding robot.
We are using a chipKIT™ Uno32™ Board, a PIC32MX320F128H processor, a L298 motor driver, a HC-SR04 sensor and an accelerometer (MPU6050) to detect if it has been picked up :car:.
